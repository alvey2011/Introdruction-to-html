<h2><u>What is HMPV Virus ?</u></h2>

    <h3><hr>Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a respiratory virus that causes illnesses ranging from mild cold-like symptoms to severe infections like pneumonia. It spreads through respiratory droplets and commonly affects children, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include fever, cough, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Proper hand hygiene and avoiding contact with sick individuals can help prevent its spread.</></h3>

 <h4><u>Why does HMPV virus happen?</u></h4>
 
 <hw5>Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections happen when the virus enters the body, typically through the nose, mouth, or eyes, via respiratory droplets from an infected person. It spreads through coughing, sneezing, or close contact, as well as by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face. Once inside the body, the virus targets the respiratory tract, causing inflammation and infection. HMPV is more likely to cause illness in individuals with weaker immune systems, such as young children, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions, as their bodies may struggle to fight off the virus effectively.</h5>
